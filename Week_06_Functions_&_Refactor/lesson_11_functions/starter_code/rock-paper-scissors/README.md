# Rock, Paper, Scissors Pseudocode:

```code
Set available options (rock, paper, scissors) -- MS NOTE: This is already done for you in the getCompPlay() function :)

When user clicks "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" button:

	Get user selection (user types in selection)

	Get computer selection (select from available options)

	If user selection is the same as computer selection
		then, say "It's a tie"

	If user selection is "rock" AND computer selection is "paper"
		then, say "You Lose"

	If user selection is "scissors" AND computer selection is "paper"
		then, say "You Win"

	If user selection is "paper" AND computer selection is "rock"
		then, say "You Win"

	If user selection is "scissors" AND computer selection is "rock"
		then, say "You Lose"

	If user selection is "paper" AND computer selection is "scissors"
		then, say "You Lose"

	If user selection is "rock" AND computer selection is "scissors"
		then, say "You Win"
