### Description


A hot, new NY Tech Startup, Relaxr, has approached you to help them develop a new landing page for their company. They've handed you the [design file](starter_code/design_file.txt) for the site, along with the copy and assets. You need to take these files and turn it into a landing page.

### Evaluation / Submission

Students will rename the "Assignment" directory in their "Week 02 - Styling" folder to read "Assignment-{INITIALS}". This is where all of the assignment files should be placed. Once completed, the students will push their code to their forked repository when they are ready to submit.

Instructional team should evaluate against the solution code and the student's use of technical elements. They will provide a numeric grade on a scale: does not meet expectations (0); meets expectations (1); exceeds expectations (2). Bonus sections are completely optional. The maximum possible score on this assignment is 12/12.
